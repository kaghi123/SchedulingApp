//In the constructor there will be a method that will check and make sure that class is available to take that semester
//If so go on, if not return an error statement
//Once in available class. When it gets time to the semester that the user wants, we will check and make sure that the class the user wants is in the available classes
//Once in combination class we will make sure that the only lists that get added to the combClass list are ones that have the user specified class in it
